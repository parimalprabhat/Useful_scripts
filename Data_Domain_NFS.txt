datadomain NFS


The Data Domain storage needs different mount options. The current options are not correct.


From the vendor (EMC) website at www.datadomain.com:

Best practices mount options:

Sun Solaris and other Unix: 
  rw,noac,hard,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,llock

Linux: 
  rw,noac,hard,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,nolock

Mounting and Verifying Exports on the NFS Client


PURPOSE : 
 
NFS allows a User to share directories and files with others over a network. This article is helpful in verifying whether an NFS export is configured correctly.

APPLIES TO :
 
All Data Domain Users
All Software Releases

SOLUTION :
 
Verify NFS is enabled
At the restorer Command Line Interface (CLI) enter the command "nfs enable":

# nfs enable
 
Verify the correct mount options are set on the Data Domain User:


# nfs show clients

path      client                   options
-------   ----------------------   ----------------------------------------
/backup   *                        (rw,no_root_squash,no_all_squash,secure)
/ddvar    *                        (rw,no_root_squash,no_all_squash,secure)
-------   ----------------------   ----------------------------------------

Enabling access to NFS on the Datadomain Restorer.
Add NFS clients that can access the Data Domain User. Use a comma- or space-separated (or both) list for multiple clients. A client can be a fully-qualified domain hostname, class-C IP addresses, IP addresses with either netmasks or length, or an asterisk (*) wildcard with a domain name, such as *.yourcompany.com. An asterisk (*) by itself means no restrictions. A client added to a sub-directory under /backup has access only to that sub-directory. ï¿½
The <nfs-options> are a comma-separated or space-separated (or both) list bounded by parentheses. With no options specified, the default options are rw, root_squash, no_all_squash, and secure. The following options are allowed:


ro
Read only permission.

rw
Read and write permissions.

root_squash
Map requests from uid/gid 0 to the anonymous uid/gid.

no_root_squash
Turn off root squashing.

all_squash
Map all user requests to the anonymous uid/gid.

no_all_squash
Turn off the mapping of all user requests to the anonymous uid/gid.

secure
Require that all requests originate on an Internet port that is less than IPPORT_RESERVED (1024).

insecure
Turns off the secure option.

anonuid=id
Set an explicit uid for the anonymous account. The id is an integer bounded from -65635 to 65635.

anongid=id
Set an explicit gid for the anonymous account. The id is an integer bounded from -65635 to 65635.

nolock
Do not use file locking.

llock
Requests that files lock locally at the NFS client. NFS network file locking requests are not sent to the NFS server if the llock option is used.



Example:

# nfs add /backup 192.168.29.30/24 (rw,no_root_squash,no_all_squash,secure)
NFS Cient Service Configuration Example

The following steps detail the requirements for configuring an NFS client. The examples demonstrate configuration on a Linux host. Refer to the clients operating-specific documentation for additional information

Make sure that NFSD daemon is running on your OS(Operating User.)
  2.     # /sbin/service nfs status
  3.     rpc.mountd is stopped
  4.     nfsd is stopped
  5.     rpc.rquotad is stopped
  6.     Currently NFS service is NOT enabled.
  
  
Issue following command to enabled the NFS client.
  8.  # /sbin/service nfs start
  9.  Starting NFS services:                                     [  OK  ]
 10.  Starting NFS quotas:                                       [  OK  ]
 11.  Starting NFS daemon:                                       [  OK  ]
 12.  Starting NFS mountd:                                       [  OK  ]
    
Verify that NFS client service is running.
 14.  #/sbin/service nfs status
 15.  rpc.mountd (pid 7748) is running...
 16.  nfsd (pid 7746 7745 7744 7743 7742 7741  7740 7739) is running...
 17.  rpc.rquotad (pid 7723) is running...
    
Mounting /backup and /ddvar NFS Shares on the NFS Client

The following procedure provides an example of configuring Linux and Solaris clients to mount NFS shares from the Data Domain User. The procedure is similar for other operating Users; although the specific commands may differ for each step. Refer to the client Operating Users documentation for specifics.
Create a directory on the NFS client to use for accessing the Data Domain share. In the following example the directory “ddr” is used.
Change to the newly created directory.

Create two sub-directories called “backup” and “ddvar” (within /ddr).
Note: Ensure the target sub-directories exist or the mount command will fail
Mount the file User on the client, using any specific mount-options required for the Operating User.
Verify the mount is successful.

Examples

Linux:
# mkdir /ddr
# cd /ddr
# mkdir backup
# mkdir ddvar
# mount -t nfs -o hard,intr,nolock,nfsvers=3,tcp,rsize=1048600,wsize=1048600,bg HOSTNAME:/backup /ddr/backup
# mount -t nfs -o hard,intr,nolock,nfsvers=3,tcp,rsize=1048600,wsize=1048600,bg HOSTNAME:/ddvar /ddr/ddvar
# ls /ddr/backup
 
Where "HOSTNAME" is the hostname or IP address of your Data Domain User.


Solaris:
# mkdir /ddr
# cd /ddr
# mkdir backup
# mkdir ddvar 
# mount -F nfs -o hard,intr,llock,vers=3,proto=tcp,rsize=1048600,wsize=1048600 HOSTNAME:/backup /ddr/backup
# mount -F nfs -o hard,intr,llock,vers=3,proto=tcp,rsize=1048600,wsize=1048600 HOSTNAME:/ddvar /ddr/ddvar
# ls /ddr/backup
 
Where "HOSTNAME" is the hostname or IP address of your Data Domain User.


AIX:
#nfso -a                                                -check nfso options
#nfso -o option=value                                   -set an nfs options
#nfso -o nfs_use_reserved_ports=1


#mkdir /ddr
# cd /ddr
# mkdir backup
# mkdir ddvar 
# mount –V nfs –o intr,hard,llock,rsize=65536,wsize=65536,vers=3,proto=tcp,\combehind,timeo=600,retrans=2 -p HOSTNAME:/backup /ddr/backup
# mount –V nfs –o intr,hard,llock,rsize=65536,wsize=65536,vers=3,proto=tcp,\combehind,timeo=600,retrans=2 -p HOSTNAME:/ddvar /ddr/ddvar
# ls /ddr/backup
 
Where "HOSTNAME" is the hostname or IP address of your Data Domain User.


Example of how to mount an mtree on a nfs client.
# mount -t nfs -o hard,intr,nolock,nfsvers=3,tcp,rsize=1048600,wsize=1048600,bg HOSTNAME:/data/col1/mtree1 /ddr/mtree1
