Dear Team,


Activity Details:

Tables reorg for the database TDHX in server phx29p3.
We are performing this activity to avoid performance issues in TDHX database.
Tables involving in this activity:

CLIENT_STORE_DELIVERY
CLIENT_RETAIL_SYNC_DELIVERY
MSTR_RETAIL_SYNC_DIM
MSTR_STORE_DIM

Steps Involved In Activity:
 
1.Take a snap of /oradata mount space before you are starting the activity.
  With this re org activity along with the performance we will reclaim some space.
  We have to project the space relaimed details after the activity completed.

Ex:

==> hostname
phx29p3
PROD:[TDHX]oracle@phx29p3:/home/oracle/tdhx_reorg/B
==> df -g /oradata
FileUser    GB blocks      Free %Used    Iused %Iused Mounted on

/dev/lv02c      4096.00    654.38   85%    89264     1% /oradata


2.RMAN hot backup for entire DB before activity

Once the deliverables of phoenix team completed Apps team will purge huge amounts from their important table.
We need a backup before team proceeding with data purge.
Apps team will request us to take RMAN hot backup.

Login into phx29p3 and crontab -l|grep TDHX ....>We will get the jobs scheduled for TDHX.
Use Weekly RMAN full hot backup and trigger it in background.
Make sure we have more than 400 GB free space in /remotebu mountpoint before u r triggering it.

Job to be triggered:

00 00 * * 6 /u01/app/oracle/admin/TDHX/scripts/rman/BACKUP_HOT.ksh > /u01/app/oracle/admin/TDHX/scripts/rman/logs/BACKUP_HOT.log 2>&1

nohup sh /u01/app/oracle/admin/TDHX/scripts/rman/BACKUP_HOT.ksh &

Monitor the backup job and update APPS team once it completed.Double crosscheck the logs once backup completed and send a confirmation to APPS team for data purge.


3.Resizing Datafiles.

Once the purge activity(usually it will take 12 hours for them) completed APPS team will give us a go ahead to proceed with RE -ORG. 

Tables Involved in this activity:

CLIENT_STORE_DELIVERY
CLIENT_RETAIL_SYNC_DELIVERY
MSTR_RETAIL_SYNC_DIM
MSTR_STORE_DIM

We are moving these tables from tablespaces A to B vice versa every month.
If tables are already present in tablespace A then we have to perform re org activity from A to B.

Find out the tables where they are located now....

SQL> set line 300
SQL> set pagesize 300
SQL> col "Table Name" form a35;
SQL>  select distinct owner "Table Owner",segment_name "Table Name", tablespace_name "Table Currently Resides In" from dba_segments where segment_name in ('CLIENT_STORE_DELIVERY','CLIENT_RETAIL_SYNC_DELIVERY','MSTR_RETAIL_SYNC_DIM','MSTR_STORE_DIM');

Table Owner                    Table Name                                                                        Table Currently Resides In
------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------
TDH                            MSTR_STORE_DIM                                                                    MSTR_STORE_DIM_TAB_B
TDH                            CLIENT_RETAIL_SYNC_DELIVERY                                                       CLIENT_RETAIL_SYNC_DEL_TAB_B
TDH                            MSTR_RETAIL_SYNC_DIM                                                              MSTR_RETAIL_SYNC_DIM_TAB_B
TDH                            CLIENT_STORE_DELIVERY                                                             CLIENT_STORE_DEL_TAB_B

All the tables are present in tablespace B.
So we have to perform re org from B to A(We have to move all these tables from B taablespaces to A).

Re org is from B------->A this case go to the directory /home/oracle/tdhx_reorg/A --->use all the scripts under this directory.

If the re ord from A----->B go to /home/oracle/tdhx_reorg/B

PROD:[TDHX]oracle@phx29p3:/home/oracle/tdhx_reorg/A
==> ls -lrt
total 96
-rw-r--r--    1 oracle   oinstall       3694 Aug 31 2011  tablespace_A.sql
-rwxr-xr-x    1 oracle   oinstall        141 Sep  2 2011  tbs_resize.sh
drwxr-xr-x    2 oracle   oinstall       4096 Nov 25 2011  table
drwxr-xr-x    2 oracle   oinstall       4096 Nov 25 2011  index


Before performing this re org activity we have to manually allocate the space(resize datafiles to 20 GB,10 GB) to datafiles of particular tablespaces.

For this just Run  --->PROD:[TDHX]oracle@phx29p3:/home/oracle/tdhx_reorg/A/tablespace_A.sql

4.Tables Reorg

We have to move all tables from tablespace_B to tablespace_A.
For this go to the directory /home/oracle/tdhx_reorg/A/table
And run all these shell scripts parallely in 4 sessions.

PROD:[TDHX]oracle@phx29p3:/home/oracle/tdhx_reorg/A/table
==> ls -lrt|grep .sh
-rwxrwxr-x    1 oracle   oinstall        160 May 27 2011  CLIENT_STORE_DELIVERY_tab.sh
-rwxrwxr-x    1 oracle   oinstall        172 May 27 2011  CLIENT_RETAIL_SYNC_DELIVERY_tab.sh
-rwxrwxr-x    1 oracle   oinstall        158 May 27 2011  MSTR_RETAIL_SYNC_DIM_tab.sh
-rwxrwxr-x    1 oracle   oinstall        146 May 27 2011  MSTR_STORE_DIM_tab.sh

Run them in background.

5.Index Reorg


select INDEX_NAME,owner,tablespace_name from all_indexes  where owner = 'TDH' and tablespace_name like '%_A';

Once we moved tables to new tablespaces indexes on tables will become INVALID.
We have to rebuild all the indexes on these tables in new tablespace.
For this run following shell scripts paralelly.

PROD:[TDHX]oracle@phx29p3:/home/oracle/tdhx_reorg/A/index
==> ls -alrt|grep .sh
-rwxr-xr-x    1 oracle   oinstall        160 May 27 2011  CLIENT_STORE_DELIVERY_ind.sh
-rwxr-xr-x    1 oracle   oinstall        172 May 27 2011  CLIENT_RETAIL_SYNC_DELIVERY_ind.sh
-rwxr-xr-x    1 oracle   oinstall        146 May 27 2011  MSTR_STORE_DIM_ind.sh
-rwxr-xr-x    1 oracle   oinstall        158 May 30 2011  MSTR_RETAIL_SYNC_DIM_ind.sh

DONT MISS ANY Shell script..:)

5.Maintenance of Parallelism

Once the indexes are created we have to maintaine no parallelism in indexes.
In reorg home directory(/home/oracle/tdhx_reorg) we have a script to complete it.

Run this script.

PROD:[TDHX]oracle@phx29p3:/home/oracle/tdhx_reorg
==> ls -lrt|grep chng.sql
-rw-r--r--    1 oracle   oinstall       1239 Jul  4 2011  noparallel_chng.sql

6.Post Verification:

Verify the tables where they are located:

select distinct owner "Table Owner",segment_name "Table Name", tablespace_name "Table Currently Resides In" from dba_segments where segment_name in ('CLIENT_STORE_DELIVERY','CLIENT_RETAIL_SYNC_DELIVERY','MSTR_RETAIL_SYNC_DIM','MSTR_STORE_DIM');

select b.INDEX_NAME,b.owner,b.tablespace_name from all_indexes b,dba_segments a  where b.owner = 'TDH' and  a.segment_name in ('CLIENT_STORE_DELIVERY','CLIENT_RETAIL_SYNC_DELIVERY','MSTR_RETAIL_SYNC_DIM','MSTR_STORE_DIM');

7.Shrinking the Datafiles

Re org of tables completed.
we have to shrink the space we already allocated for the tablespace's_A in step 3.
Run maxshrink.sql in reorg home directory.

PROD:[TDHX]oracle@phx29p3:/home/oracle/tdhx_reorg
==> ls -lrt|grep ink.sql
-rw-r--r--    1 oracle   oinstall       1314 Jul  4 2011  maxshrink.sql


8.RMAN hot backup for entire DB after activity

Once all the activity completed take RMAN hot backup of the database.
Refer step2.
 

9.We have to gather the statistics for all the tables involved in this activity.

PROD:[TDHX]oracle@phx29p3:/home/oracle/tdhx_reorg
==> ls -lrt|grep her.sql
-rw-r--r--    1 oracle   oinstall        874 May 30 2011  stats_gather.sql

10.Once all the activies completed APPS team will request us to bounce the database TDHX(Some times DCVX also).
Bounce the DB.

Take /oradata mountpoint space usage details ... Refer step1.

Share the space relaimation detils with apps team.

Follow up without delay.Update APPS team on each step starting/Completion.
It will avoid escalations.
